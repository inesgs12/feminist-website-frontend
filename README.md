## About

The goal is that the Feminist Hub becomes your go-to page for all things feminist - where you can learn about feminism and join a community of like-minded people.

This website is the result of 15 weeks of learning at Flatiron School's Immersive Software Engineering Bootcamp. At the moment, I seeded some feminist books, authors and theories for the final showcase. This is just the starting point, I will keep adding as time goes by.

## Technology

This app was built with Rails in the backend and React in the frontend. The design was created using a combination of CSS and UI frameworks.

At the moment, it's **not** mobile-friendly but **I intend to built it using React Native shortly**. I'm very proud of the outcome considering we had two weeks to come up with the idea.

- Ruby on Rails
- React.JS
- HTML / CSS / Semantic UI
